# Titanic-Dataset-Data-Analysis-using-R

To summarize in bullet points, there are following merits.

- There is a lot of good literature for data visualization and analysis.

- With ggplot, we can create high quality plots without tuning. 

- ggplot has a consistent API and is easy to use. The ggplot object and the geom object allow for a very good syntax and abstraction of the plots.

- With dplyr, it is easy to write complex data wranglings. The Pipe operator can be used to concisely describe the data wrangling process to be followed.

Using R, we can easily perform beautiful plots and analysis using a very well-developed API. We can also refer to the literature of good statistical users who are using R as their main tool.
